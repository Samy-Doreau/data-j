# Data-J

A small, growing collection of code snippets (R, Python, and Jupyter notebooks) to support data journalism projects.

## What's inside
- R: data cleaning, analysis, visualization, scraping
- Python: data processing, scraping, charts, simple models
- Notebooks: end-to-end, reproducible walkthroughs

## How to use
- Browse the folders, copy what you need, and adapt.
- Notebooks live in `notebooks/` and can be run with Jupyter or VS Code.

## Requirements
- R (tidyverse recommended)
- Python 3.8+ (pandas/matplotlib recommended)

## Contributing
